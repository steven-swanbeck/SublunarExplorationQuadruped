# Sublunar Exploration Quadruped

## Description
This project was created as part of a NASA University Student Design Challenge to create a robotic system capable of navigating and mapping subsurface lava tubes on the moon to assess their ability to sustain long-term human occupancy.

The miniature quadruped is capable of remote-controlled traversal of treacherous terrain and features self-stabilization, variable gait adjustment, and the ability to create detailed 3D point cloud maps of its surroundings using LIDAR.
